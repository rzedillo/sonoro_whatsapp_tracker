⎿ WhatsApp Tracker Refactoring Plan

    Overview

    Complete migration from Node.js monolithic WhatsApp bot to Python multi-agent orchestration 
    system using the enhanced framework architecture with test-first cloud deployment.

    Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

    1. Local Development Environment
      - Implement Docker Compose mirroring Google Cloud production
      - Set up PostgreSQL, Redis, FastAPI, Streamlit containers
      - Configure local environment validation scripts
      - Create .env.local with development settings
    2. Database Migration
      - Convert SQLite TaskManager schema to PostgreSQL models
      - Implement Alembic migrations
      - Set up Redis for caching and session management

    Phase 2: Core Agent System

    1. Multi-Agent Architecture
      - Create base agent classes following framework patterns
      - Implement WhatsApp message processing agent
      - Build task management orchestration agent
      - Add context management and shared state
    2. WhatsApp Integration
      - Port whatsapp-web.js functionality to Python
      - Preserve message processing and QR code authentication
      - Implement webhook-based message handling

    Phase 3: Backend API & Frontend

    1. FastAPI Backend
      - Create REST API endpoints with health checks
      - Implement agent orchestration endpoints
      - Add authentication and security middleware
    2. Streamlit Frontend
      - Build dashboard for task viewing and management
      - Create WhatsApp connection status interface
      - Add real-time message monitoring

    Phase 4: Local Testing Framework

    1. Comprehensive Local Testing
      - Unit tests for all agents and components
      - Integration tests for WhatsApp functionality
      - End-to-end workflow tests in Docker environment
      - Performance and security testing locally
      - MANDATORY: All tests must pass locally before cloud deployment
    2. Local Validation Scripts
      - ./scripts/run-tests-for-cloud.sh - Complete test suite
      - Pre-push git hooks to prevent deployment without local testing
      - Test evidence generation for CI/CD validation

    Phase 5: Google Cloud Deployment Pipeline

    1. CI/CD Pipeline Setup
      - Google Cloud Build configuration with local test validation
      - Multi-environment setup (dev, staging, prod)
      - Enforcement: Pipeline blocks deployment if no local test evidence
      - Automatic rollback on deployment failure
    2. Cloud Infrastructure
      - Cloud Run services for backend and frontend
      - Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) for production database
      - Cloud Memory Store (Redis) for caching
      - Cloud Build triggers for automated deployment
    3. Environment Strategy
      - Development: Quick deployment with minimal validation
      - Staging: Full test suite + integration testing
      - Production: Enhanced security, blue-green deployment

    Key Framework Alignment

    - Local-First Development: Docker Compose mirrors production exactly
    - Test-First Deployment: Cloud deployment only after local validation
    - Evidence-Based CI/CD: Pipeline requires proof of local testing
    - Multi-Environment: Dev → Staging → Production progression
    - Health Monitoring: Comprehensive health checks and automatic rollback

    Breaking Changes

    - Complete technology stack change (Node.js → Python)
    - Database migration required (SQLite → PostgreSQL)
    - Deployment Philosophy: Must test locally before cloud deployment
    - Configuration format changes with environment-specific settings

    Success Criteria

    1. Local Environment: Identical behavior to production
    2. Testing: 100% local test pass rate before any cloud deployment
    3. CI/CD: Automated deployment with rollback capabilities
    4. Monitoring: Real-time health checks and alerting

    This plan fully embraces the framework's "test locally, deploy confidently to cloud" philosophy 
    with Google Cloud as the target production environment.

✻ Thinking…

  Great! The user approved the updated plan that now properly emphasizes the "test locally, deploy 
  to cloud" philosophy with Google Cloud deployment. Now I can start implementing the refactoring. 

  Let me update my todo list to reflect the implementation phases and begin with Phase 1: 
  Infrastructure Setup.

  Based on the approved plan, I should:
  1. Update my todo list with the implementation phases
  2. Start with Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
  3. Create the new project structure following the framework standards
  4. Set up the Docker Compose environment

  Looking at the framework documentation I read, I should create:
  - Project structure following the standard layout
  - Docker Compose configuration for local development
  - Environment configuration files
  - Basic directory structure for agents, core, database, etc.
